Hallo nerds, currently learning more Java and trying to search for new language cause I'm bored, you will mostly see me posting open source Minecraft Projects which are usually stolen code and I somtimes post my own clients made for practice purposes 👍

✔ You will see some interesting stuff in my profile.
👌 You will see some cool forks I can find.
