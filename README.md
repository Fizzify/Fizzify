Hello, currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, React, Electron, SCSS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, EJS, and Svelte(doesn't mean I know it). You will find my projects(which are open-source) on my profile. I'm willing to learn other libraries like Next.js or Vite in the future.

I am currently 14 years old in JHS.

✔ You will see some interesting stuff in my profile.

👌 You will see some cool forks I can find.

👍 If you are using my code, please don't just steal it and actually learn from it.
